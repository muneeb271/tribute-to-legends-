About the Legend
</h5>



<p>
☛ Iqbal's views on the Western world have been applauded by Westerners, including
United States Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas, who said that Iqbal's
beliefs had "universal appeal".[95] Soviet biographer N. P. Anikoy wrote:
<br><br>
☛ [Iqbal is] great for his passionate condemnation of weak will and passiveness,
his angry protest against inequality, discrimination and oppression in all forms, i.e.,
economic, social, political, national, racial, religious, etc., his preaching of optimism,
an active attitude towards life and man's high purpose in the world, in a word, he is great for his
assertion of the noble ideals and principles of humanism, democracy, peace and friendship among peoples
<br><br>
☛ Others, including Wilfred Cantwell Smith, stated that with Iqbal's anti-capitalist holdings, he was "anti-intellect", because "capitalism fosters intellect".[95] Freeland Abbott objected to Iqbal's views of the West, saying that they were based on the role of imperialism and that Iqbal was not immersed enough in Western culture to learn about the various benefits of the modern democracies, economic practices and science.
<br><br>
☛ Critics of Abbot's viewpoint note that Iqbal was raised and educated in the European way of life,
and spent enough time there to grasp the general concepts of Western civilisation.[95]
<br><br>
☛Iqbal is widely commemorated in Pakistan, where he is regarded as the ideological founder of the state

<br><br> ☛ You the [dwellers] of the West, should know thatthe world of God is not a shop (of yours).
<br><br> ☛ Your imagined pure gold is about to lose itsstandard value (as fixed by you).
<br><br> ☛ Iqbal married three times under different circumstances.[31]


<br><br> ☛ Iqbal's second marriage was with Mukhtar Begum, and it was held in December 1914,
shortly after the death of Iqbal's mother the previous November.[36][29] They had a son,
but both the mother and son died shortly after birth in 1924.[31]
<br><br> ☛ Later, Iqbal married Sardar Begum, and they became the parents of a son,
Javed Iqbal (1924–2015), who became Senior Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan,
and a daughter, Muneera Bano (born 1930).[31][35] One of Muneera's sons is the philanthropist
-cum-socialite Yousuf Salahuddin.[35]

A poet, philosopher, politician, lawyer, and scholar, Iqbal was born on November 9, 1877,
in Punjab, Pakistan, to Kashmiri parents and educated at Scotch Mission College in Sialkot.
